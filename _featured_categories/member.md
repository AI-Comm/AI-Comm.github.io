<!-- Here you should be able to find everything you need to know to accomplish the most common tasks when blogging with Hydejack.
Should you think something is missing, [please let me know](mailto:mail@qwtel.com).
Should you discover a mistake in the docs (or a bug in general) feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/issues) on GitHub.

While this manual tries to be beginner-friendly, as a user of Jekyll it is assumed that you are comfortable running shell commands and editing text files.
